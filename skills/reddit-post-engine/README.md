2. Go to [download-directory.github.io](https://download-directory.github.io/).
3. Paste the URL and click **Enter** to download.

**Step 2: Install in Claude**

1. Open your **Claude desktop app**.
2. Go to the sidebar on the left side and click on the **Customize** section.
3. Click on the **Skills** tab, then click on the **+** button to create a new skill.
4. Choose **Upload a skill**, then drag and drop the `.zip` file or extracted folder.

> **Note:** For some skills, the `SKILL.md` file might be located inside a subfolder. Always upload the specific folder that contains the `SKILL.md` file.

Run these commands inside Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Varnan-Tech/opendirectory

[**Install in Manus AI**](https://manus.im/import-skills?githubUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FVarnan-Tech%2Fopendirectory%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fskills%2Freddit-post-engine&utm_source=opendirectory)

Manus AI users can import a skill directly from its OpenDirectory skill page. This is the easiest path when you want Manus to pull the skill from GitHub for you.

1. Open the skill you want from the [OpenDirectory homepage](https://opendirectory.dev).
2. In the install panel, select the **Manus AI** tab.
3. Click **Install in Manus AI** - this opens Manus with the skill GitHub URL already attached.
4. Confirm the import inside Manus AI.

> If your Manus workspace prefers file uploads, use the **Download** tab instead and upload the downloaded `.skill.zip` file inside Manus.

## What It Does

- Fetches the target subreddit's rules and top posts from Reddit's public API
- Identifies the subreddit's tone and posting conventions
- Drafts a title and body that match the community's style
- Keeps product links out of the body (puts them in the first comment)
- Optionally posts directly via Composio
- Covers 7 common subreddits with specific playbooks

## Requirements

| Requirement | Purpose | How to Set Up |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| Gemini API key | Post drafting and tone matching | aistudio.google.com, Get API key |
| Composio Reddit MCP (optional) | Direct posting | app.composio.dev |

## Setup

### 1. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add GEMINI_API_KEY (required)
# Add COMPOSIO_API_KEY if you want direct posting
```

### 2. Connect Reddit via Composio (optional)

Direct posting requires a Composio account connected to Reddit OAuth:

1. Get your Composio API key at app.composio.dev/settings
2. Connect Reddit at app.composio.dev/app/reddit
3. Add the MCP server to Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http reddit-composio \
  "https://mcp.composio.dev/reddit/YOUR_COMPOSIO_API_KEY"
```

4. Verify: `claude mcp list` should show `reddit-composio`

Without Composio, the skill drafts posts for manual copy-paste submission.

## How to Use

Draft a post for a specific subreddit:
```
"Help me post my project on r/SideProject"
"Write a Reddit post for r/devops about my Kubernetes tool"
"Draft something for r/startups: we hit $1k MRR"
```

With direct posting:
```
"Post my project to r/SideProject via Composio"
```

Multi-subreddit drafts:
```
"Draft posts for r/SideProject and r/indiehackers for my launch"
```

## Subreddit Playbook Summary

| Subreddit | Tone | What Works |
|-----------|------|------------|
| r/devops | Technical, direct | Problem + solution + specific numbers |
| r/SideProject | Personal, builder | Build story + honest state + link in comment |
| r/startups | Business-focused | Lessons learned + metrics |
| r/programming | Technical, skeptical | Novel approach + code examples |
| r/ExperiencedDevs | Senior-level | Nuanced tradeoffs, no hand-holding |
| r/indiehackers | Transparent | Revenue numbers, real story |
| r/webdev | Friendly | What you built + how it works |

## The 90/10 Rule

Reddit detects promotional patterns. For your posts to land well, 90% of your Reddit activity should be genuine community contribution: answering questions, discussing topics, sharing interesting links. At most 10% should be posts about your own work.

This skill drafts high-quality posts, but the underlying account reputation matters. New accounts with no history posting self-promotional content often get filtered.
