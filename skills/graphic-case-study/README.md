## What it does

- Asks the questions that determine how the case study should be structured
- Interviews you (or processes your notes) to extract customer story details
- Structures the narrative: customer context → challenge → solution → results → testimonial
- Generates a single self-contained HTML file -- opens in any browser, no build tools
- Splits into per-page HTML files for individual sharing or editing
- Exports a print-ready PDF via Playwright (A4 portrait, 1200×1697px)
- Supports 1-pager summary card, standard 2-pager, and detailed 4-pager formats

## Example

> "Create a 2-page case study for Acme Corp. They were spending 20 hrs/week on manual reporting. We automated it. They saved 80% of that time and reduced errors by 95%. Use midnight-editorial style."

Output: 2-page PDF with cover, challenge/solution spread, results stat page, and closing CTA.
