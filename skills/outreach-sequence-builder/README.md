## What It Does

- Identifies the signal type from 7 categories: Post-Fundraise, Hiring Signal, Competitor Displacement, Product Launch, Content Engagement, Event Follow-up, Job Change
- Loads your ICP from docs/icp.md or asks 4 questions to define target persona and pain points
- Develops the Insight, Bridge, Opener, and Ask for the specific signal
- Plans a 4-6 touchpoint channel sequence over 10-14 days
- Generates all messages with Gemini, enforcing hard limits (100-word emails, 300-character LinkedIn notes, 20-word phone openers)
- Pre-empts 2-4 objections woven into existing touchpoints
- Runs a 13-point QA pass before presenting the sequence
- Saves the sequence to docs/sequences/ and optionally drafts emails in Gmail via Composio

## Requirements

| Requirement | Purpose | How to Set Up |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| Gemini API key | Sequence generation | aistudio.google.com, Get API key |
| Composio API key (optional) | Gmail draft creation | app.composio.dev, API Keys |

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (required)
- `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` (optional, for Gmail draft creation)

Optional: create `docs/icp.md` with your target personas, company profile, pain points, and differentiators. If the file does not exist, the skill asks 4 questions before generating.

## How to Use

Basic sequence from a signal:

```
"Build an outreach sequence for a prospect who just raised a Series B"
"They're hiring 8 engineers — write me a sequence"
"Create outreach based on this signal: they just launched a new product"
```

With contact context:

```
"Build an outreach sequence for Sarah Chen, VP Sales at Momentum CRM — they just raised $22M Series B"
"They switched from Salesforce and posted a frustrated LinkedIn comment. Write a competitor displacement sequence."
```

With Gmail drafting:

```
"Build a post-fundraise sequence and draft the emails in Gmail"
```

## Signal Types

| Signal | Definition | Window |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Post-Fundraise | Company raised a round in the last 30 days | 48 hours from announcement |
| Hiring Signal | Company posted 5 or more roles in a function you serve | Within the week posts appear |
| Competitor Displacement | Contact is using a competitor and showing frustration | Within 24 hours |
| Product Launch | Company launched a new product or major feature | 2-4 weeks after launch |
| Content Engagement | Contact liked, commented, or shared your content | Start on LinkedIn first |
| Event Follow-up | You met at a conference or webinar | Within 48 hours of event |
| Job Change | Contact moved to a new company in the last 60 days | Within 2 weeks of announcement |

## Message Rules

- Only `{{first_name}}` is allowed as a variable. All other details must be filled in from context.
- Email bodies: 100 words maximum.
- LinkedIn notes: 300 characters maximum.
- Phone openers: 20 words maximum.
- No placeholders like `[Company Name]` or `[INSERT PAIN POINT]`. If the information is not available, the skill asks before writing.

## Output

The sequence is saved to `docs/sequences/{signal-type}.md`. Each touchpoint includes:

- Channel and day number
- Two subject line variants (email)
- Message body
- Word count (email) or character count (LinkedIn)
- Phone talk track with voicemail script
