## What it does

1. Takes a content brief (what each scene should say) and style params
2. Generates a multi-scene HTML/CSS animation file
3. Captures frames via Playwright + Web Animations API seeking
4. Assembles PNG sequence → H.264 MP4 with FFmpeg
5. Optionally mixes in background audio

## Differentiator vs SkillsMP

All top SkillsMP motion-graphic skills require Remotion (React build step) or AI video APIs (Runway, Kling — cost + rate limits). This skill uses the proven HTML/CSS → Playwright → FFmpeg pipeline from the `graphic-gif` family: zero new dependencies, pixel-perfect output, full CSS control.
