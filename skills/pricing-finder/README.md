# pricing-finder

Tell it what your product is (URL or description). It finds 5 competitors globally, fetches their actual pricing pages, and returns a complete pricing intelligence report: the dominant pricing model in your space, a benchmark price table, feature gate analysis, a competitive positioning map, and a concrete recommended pricing strategy for your product.

**Zero API keys required.** Runs entirely on free pip dependencies.

## Install

### Option A: npx CLI (Recommended)

No global install. Always runs the latest version.

```bash
npx "@opendirectory.dev/skills" install pricing-finder --target claude
```

### Option B: Claude Desktop App

**Step 1: Download the skill from GitHub**

1. Copy the URL of this specific skill folder from your browser's address bar.
2. Go to [download-directory.github.io](https://download-directory.github.io/).
3. Paste the URL and click **Enter** to download.

**Step 2: Install in Claude**

1. Open your **Claude desktop app**.
2. Go to the sidebar on the left side and click on the **Customize** section.
3. Click on the **Skills** tab, then click on the **+** button to create a new skill.
4. Choose **Upload a skill**, then drag and drop the `.zip` file or extracted folder.

> **Note:** For some skills, the `SKILL.md` file might be located inside a subfolder. Always upload the specific folder that contains the `SKILL.md` file.

### Option C: Claude Code Native

Run these commands inside Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Varnan-Tech/opendirectory
/plugin install opendirectory-gtm-skills@opendirectory-marketplace
```

### Option D: Manus AI

<video src="https://www.opendirectory.dev/ManusAI-one-click-installation-demo.webm" controls width="100%"></video>

[**Install in Manus AI**](https://manus.im/import-skills?githubUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FVarnan-Tech%2Fopendirectory%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fskills%2Fpricing-finder&utm_source=opendirectory)

Manus AI users can import a skill directly from its OpenDirectory skill page. This is the easiest path when you want Manus to pull the skill from GitHub for you.

1. Open the skill you want from the [OpenDirectory homepage](https://opendirectory.dev).
2. In the install panel, select the **Manus AI** tab.
3. Click **Install in Manus AI** - this opens Manus with the skill GitHub URL already attached.
4. Confirm the import inside Manus AI.

> If your Manus workspace prefers file uploads, use the **Download** tab instead and upload the downloaded `.skill.zip` file inside Manus.

## Setup

```bash
# Set up free Python dependencies (required)
pip install ddgs requests beautifulsoup4 html2text
```

No API keys needed. Optionally add keys to `.env` for better quality:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Uncomment TAVILY_API_KEY or FIRECRAWL_API_KEY if you have them
```

## Usage

```
Find pricing benchmarks for my startup: https://yourstartup.com
```

Or paste a description if you don't have a live URL:

```
Find pricing benchmarks. We build [what you do] for [who]. [Stage], [geography].
```

## What It Does

1. Fetches your product page to understand what you're building
2. Analyzes your product: category, differentiators, ICP
3. Discovers 5 competitors in your space via DuckDuckGo search
4. **Asks you to confirm the competitor list** before fetching any data
5. Fetches each competitor's pricing page (3-tier fallback: direct fetch → Google cache → search snippet)
6. Extracts structured pricing data: tiers, prices, limits, feature gates
7. Analyzes patterns across all 5 competitors
8. Maps competitive positioning and identifies underserved gaps
9. Recommends a concrete pricing strategy for your product

## Output

A pricing intel report saved to `docs/pricing-intel/[product-slug]-[date].md` containing:

- **Pricing Model Analysis** -- dominant model in your space (per-seat / flat-rate / usage-based / freemium) and why
- **Price Point Benchmark Table** -- every competitor's tiers with exact prices, free tier, free trial
- **Market ranges** -- entry tier median, mid tier median, enterprise floor
- **Feature Gate Analysis** -- what's always free, what's always paid, what varies
- **Competitive Positioning Map** -- who owns cheap+simple, middle market, enterprise, and where the gap is
- **Recommended Pricing Strategy** -- model, entry price, mid price, top price, free tier decision, annual discount, what to gate behind paid

## Cost

**$0.00.** Entirely free using pip dependencies.

Optional API upgrades:
- Tavily API (free tier: 1000 credits/month) -- better search results
- Firecrawl API (free tier: 500 credits/month) -- better JS-heavy page rendering

## Zero-Hallucination Policy

Every price in the output traces to fetched pricing page content or a search snippet. "Contact Sales" is recorded exactly -- never estimated. Fields that could not be sourced are labeled "not found in page data." Low-quality data (search snippets) is explicitly flagged so you know which competitors to verify manually.

## How Pricing Page Fetching Works

The script tries three methods per competitor, in order:

1. **Direct fetch** (`requests` + `beautifulsoup4` + `html2text`) -- works for most pricing pages since companies make them SEO-friendly and server-rendered
2. **Google cache** -- fallback for recently-changed pages or soft blocks
3. **Search snippet** -- last resort; marks data quality as "low" in the output

If you have a Firecrawl API key, it replaces step 1 with a fully JS-rendered fetch.
