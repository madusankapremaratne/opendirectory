# Twitter GTM Find Skill

<img width="1280" height="640" alt="Generated_chart__twitter-gtm-find-cover-bw png" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/618b0abe-34fc-4c3e-a345-1a3eaeb3d20b" />

This repository contains the `twitter-GTM-find/` AI Skill. 

This pipeline automates the discovery of highly-targeted, Developer-First startups hiring for Go-To-Market (GTM), Developer Relations (DevRel), and Growth roles by scraping Twitter (via Apify) and automatically verifying the startups' funding and product type using Gemini's native Google Search Grounding.

## Install

```bash
npx "@opendirectory.dev/skills" install twitter-GTM-find-skill --target claude
```

### Video Tutorial

### Step 1: Download the skill from GitHub
1. Copy the URL of this specific skill folder from your browser's address bar.
2. Go to [download-directory.github.io](https://download-directory.github.io/).
3. Paste the URL and click **Enter** to download.

### Step 2: Install the Skill in Claude
1. Open your **Claude desktop app**.
2. Go to the sidebar on the left side and click on the **Customize** section.
3. Click on the **Skills** tab, then click on the **+** (plus) icon button to create a new skill.
4. Choose the option to **Upload a skill**, and drag and drop the `.zip` file (or you can extract it and drop the folder, both work).

> **Note:** For some skills (like `position-me`), the `SKILL.md` file might be located inside a subfolder. Always make sure you are uploading the specific folder that contains the `SKILL.md` file!

## The Skill Directory

All executable code and documentation are packaged cleanly inside the `twitter-GTM-find/` folder. This is designed to be directly imported and read by AI agents (like OpenClaw or Claude) so they understand how to use the tool.

```text
twitter-GTM-find/
├── SKILL.md             <-- The AI entry point and documentation
├── references/          
│   └── icp-checklist.md <-- The strict evaluation criteria (Dev-first + $100K+ funded)
└── scripts/
    ├── run_pipeline.sh  <-- The executable shell script
    └── src/             <-- The TypeScript pipeline source code
```

## Usage

To run the pipeline manually or via an agent:

1. Create a `.env` file at the root of the repository:
   ```env
   APIFY_API_TOKEN=your_apify_token
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   MAX_POSTS=20
   ```
2. Run the shell script:
   ```bash
   cd twitter-GTM-find/scripts
   bash run_pipeline.sh
   ```

## Optional Hermes Tweet Path

The existing Apify pipeline remains the default end-to-end workflow. For Hermes
users who already run
[Hermes Tweet](https://github.com/Xquik-dev/hermes-tweet), the skill can also
use Hermes Tweet as a native Hermes Agent X/Twitter plugin for the first
discovery pass:

```bash
hermes plugins install Xquik-dev/hermes-tweet --enable
```

After setting `XQUIK_API_KEY`, use `tweet_explore` to scrape/search tweets or
search Twitter/X for GTM, DevRel, growth, and startup hiring signals. Use
`tweet_read` to read tweet replies, look up users, and monitor tweets from
promising founders or company accounts. Use `tweet_action` only for read-side
exports such as export followers during this workflow.

Keep the pipeline's validation step intact: export the Hermes Tweet findings
into the same candidate review shape, then run the ICP checks before any
outreach. Post tweets, post replies, send DMs, and other automate X actions
should stay confirmation-gated and outside unattended discovery runs.

## Output

The pipeline generates two temporary files at the root of the repository (which are `.gitignore`d to prevent leaking data):
- `radar-jobs.json`: The initial raw batch of scraped tech jobs.
- `openclaw-icp-jobs.json`: The final, strict ICP-validated list of highly funded, developer-first startups hiring right now.
