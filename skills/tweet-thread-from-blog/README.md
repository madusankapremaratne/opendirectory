Turn any blog post or article into a Twitter/X thread. The agent reads the content, picks the right thread style, and writes 7-10 tweets with a strong hook, one insight per tweet, and a CTA. Optionally posts the full thread to X via Composio using a reply chain.

## Install

```

### Option B: Claude Desktop App

**Step 1: Download the skill from GitHub**

1. Copy the URL of this specific skill folder from your browser's address bar.
2. Go to [download-directory.github.io](https://download-directory.github.io/).
3. Paste the URL and click **Enter** to download.

**Step 2: Install in Claude**

1. Open your **Claude desktop app**.
2. Go to the sidebar on the left side and click on the **Customize** section.
3. Click on the **Skills** tab, then click on the **+** button to create a new skill.
4. Choose **Upload a skill**, then drag and drop the `.zip` file or extracted folder.

> **Note:** For some skills, the `SKILL.md` file might be located inside a subfolder. Always upload the specific folder that contains the `SKILL.md` file.

### Option C: Claude Code Native

Run these commands inside Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Varnan-Tech/opendirectory
/plugin install opendirectory-gtm-skills@opendirectory-marketplace
```

### Option D: Manus AI

<video src="https://www.opendirectory.dev/ManusAI-one-click-installation-demo.webm" controls width="100%"></video>

[**Install in Manus AI**](https://manus.im/import-skills?githubUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FVarnan-Tech%2Fopendirectory%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fskills%2Ftweet-thread-from-blog&utm_source=opendirectory)

Manus AI users can import a skill directly from its OpenDirectory skill page. This is the easiest path when you want Manus to pull the skill from GitHub for you.

1. Open the skill you want from the [OpenDirectory homepage](https://opendirectory.dev).
2. In the install panel, select the **Manus AI** tab.
3. Click **Install in Manus AI** - this opens Manus with the skill GitHub URL already attached.
4. Confirm the import inside Manus AI.

> If your Manus workspace prefers file uploads, use the **Download** tab instead and upload the downloaded `.skill.zip` file inside Manus.

## Thread Styles

| Style | Use When | Example Input |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Data/Insight | Evidence-based article with stats or research findings | Engineering blog post with benchmark numbers |
| How-To | Tutorial or step-by-step guide | "How to set up X in 10 minutes" post |
| Story/Journey | Personal experience, build log, lessons learned | Indie hacker retrospective |
| Hot Take | Opinion piece, contrarian argument | "Why X is wrong" editorial |

The agent auto-detects the right style. Override it by specifying the style in your prompt.

## Requirements

No LLM API key needed. The agent reads the page and writes the thread.

**Note on X/Twitter posting:** Twitter's API v2 now requires a paid developer account (Basic tier, $100/month minimum). As a result, the Composio Twitter integration returns a 403 error for most users. The skill still generates complete, ready-to-post threads — just copy-paste them manually. Direct posting via Composio is documented below but is only viable if you have a paid Twitter developer account connected.

## Setup

### 1. Configure environment variables (optional)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add COMPOSIO_API_KEY if you want direct posting to X
```

### 2. Connect X/Twitter via Composio (optional, requires paid Twitter developer account)

Twitter's API v2 now requires a paid developer account before Composio can post on your behalf. If you get a 403 error, this is why. Skip this step and use copy-paste output instead.

1. Sign up for Twitter Developer Portal (Basic tier, ~$100/month): https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products
2. Get your Composio API key at: https://app.composio.dev/settings
3. Connect your X/Twitter account at: https://app.composio.dev/app/twitter
4. Complete the OAuth flow

## How to Use

From a URL:

```
"Turn this into a tweet thread: https://example.com/blog/post"
"Create a Twitter thread from this article: https://example.com/post"
"Write a tweet thread about this blog post: https://example.com/tutorial"
```

From pasted content:

```
"Make a thread from this: [paste article text]"
"Turn this into a Twitter thread: [paste blog post]"
```

With a style override:

```
"Turn this into a How-To thread: https://example.com/data-article"
"Write a Hot Take thread from this: https://example.com/opinion"
```

With direct posting (requires paid Twitter developer account + Composio setup):

```
"Post this blog post as a Twitter thread: https://example.com/post"
```

## Output

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Full thread | 7-10 numbered tweets, each under 280 characters |
| Alternative hook | A second hook tweet in a different format |
| Posted confirmation | If COMPOSIO_API_KEY is set and you confirm, the thread posts as a reply chain on X |

## How Threads Are Formatted

Hook first. Tweet 1 leads with the most surprising insight or a curiosity gap. It never announces the thread.

One idea per tweet. If a tweet can be split, it gets split. Each tweet stands alone.

Numbered throughout. Every tweet starts with its position: "1/8", "2/8", etc.

CTA last. The final tweet is the only one with a URL or call to action.

No hashtags. Hashtags reduce the quality signal of technical threads.
